1.In order to better study how Inner Monologue improves reasoning in especially challenging scenarios, we consider an experiment variant where we add adversarial disturbances during control policy executions that cause skill policy rollouts to fail. (Inner Monologue: Embodied Reasoning through Planning with Language Models) Evaluate across methods

2. Robustness to Feedback Order. instruction is injected in the middle of the plan execution to check if the plan will repolicy.

3. Robustness to Typos.
